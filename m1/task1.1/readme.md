# Task results

## Work progress:

The first task was to put GIT into practice. After creating the GIT repository and cloning it to the computer, the initial project structure was created, where the readme.txt file needs to be created in the specified folder. After that, we need to create a new branch called develop and an index.html file. Then you need to create a branch called images, create a folder with the same name, which will contain the image, the link to which will need to be entered in index.html. Now we need to create a branch called styles with a folder where the css file will be stored, to which you also need to create a link in index.html.Then we go to the develop branch and start merging our images and styles branches into it. When this is ready, the develop branch should be merged into the main branch. At this stage, there may be a conflict that needs to be resolved and after taht we can push. We also need to create a log file and push it to the repository.

## What is DevOps:
It seems to me that DevOps is a whole methodology for software development, which should help solve many problems that may arise during the development stages and speed up the release of a product to the market. A DevOps specialist must have extensive knowledge in various technical areas in order to perform their work as efficiently as possible.
